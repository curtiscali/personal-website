If you've been exploring this site long enough to see this post, thank you very much for stopping by!

This site is the culmination of years of desire, and finally taking the time to put in the work to not only code this site,
but also taking the time to register domain names, get hosting setup, and deal with all the various logistical issues present
when putting a new website on the internet.

That culmination, however, I hope will only be the beginning of an amazing journey we can share together!

On this blog I hope to share my thoughts on:
<ul>
    <li>Current Events in Tech</li>
    <li>How to navigate professional development</li>
    <li>Life in General</li>
</ul>
